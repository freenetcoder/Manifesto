### NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW

### 1. Abstract
Speaking at a decentralised Internet conference,  Edward Snowden has warned that Bitcoin’s public ledger is a
“long-lasting flaw” that has large implications for the overall privacy of the cryptocurrency. 

Bitcoin is built on a piece of technology called the blockchain, which is a record of transactions that’s available 
to view by anyone. It’s also decentralised, meaning that its data is held in multiple locations all around the world, 
without being in the control of one single organisation.

The public ledger means that it’s actually possible for anyone to view the transactions (ammounts and addresses) that 
are taking place, even if the blockchain doesn’t tell you who each of its digital wallets belongs to.

Knowledge amounts and addresses means a different agencies could, track a Bitcoin transaction from these addresses, 
and follow the transactions until they end up at an centralized exchange. It is also possible to track the IP addresses 
of a Bitcoin transactions if an entity runs a large amount of relay nodes on the network.

Such organizations are paying close attention to addresses with transfers of large sums of funds. And therefore the public
ledger must hide real transaction amounts and addresses. Although there are Add-in methods of increasing the privacy of 
transactions on the blockchain uses at privacy coins such as Zcash and Monero, we sees more promise in cryptocurrencies 
built from the ground with default build-in privacy.
